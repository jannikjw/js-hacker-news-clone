# Assignment II: Centerling News

Welcome to the second assignment of the Web Development elective!
In this assignment you will implement a clone of Y-Combinators popular deep-tech news platform Hacker News.
You can find the complete instructions in the PDF in this repository.

The goal of this exercise is to familiarize and practice developing a full stack web application.
You will develop an API with [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/), [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Backend) and a client-facing user interface in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) (Frontend).
The overall time to complete this exercise is probably somewhere **between 20 and 30 hours**, depending on your speed.

> **Note:** This is the first time we do this elective.
> We would like to know how much time it takes you to complete the assignments to improve this course in the future.
> We would be grateful, if you could to track the time it takes you to complete this assignments.
> We recommend tools like toggl.com or clockify.me for this.
>
> How long it takes you to finish any assignment will not affect grading in any way.
